To exploit a website, you first need to know how they are created.

# Task 1 How websites work

When you visit a website, your browser (like Safari or Google Chrome) makes a request to a web server asking for information about the page you're visiting. It will respond with data that your browser uses to show you the page; a web server is just a dedicated computer somewhere else in the world that handles your requests.

## What term best describes the side your browser renders a website?  

- Client side

# Task 2 HTML

Websites are primarily created using:

- HTML, to build websites and define their structure

- CSS, to make websites look pretty by adding styling options

- JavaScript, implement complex features on pages using interactivity

## Let's play with some HTML! On the right-hand side, you should see a box that renders HTML - If you enter some HTML into the box and click the green "Render HTML Code" button, it will render your HTML on the page; you should see an image of some cats.

- No Answer needed

## One of the images on the cat website is broken - fix it, and the image will reveal the hidden text answer!

just put the extension of the picture like above **jpg**

# Task 3 JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is one of the most popular coding languages in the world and allows pages to become interactive.

## Click the "View Site" button on this task. On the right-hand side, add JavaScript that changes the demo element's content to "Hack the Planet"

Delete the comment and put the code of js that can change the content from "Hi! There"
to "Hack the planet"

# Task 4 Sensitive Data Exposure

Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when a website doesn't properly protect (or remove) sensitive clear-text information to the end-user; usually found in a site's frontend source code.

## View the website on this task. What is the password hidden in the source code?

Simply we can test any fake credential to get anything helpful
I will put 123 and user and password ..

So we gotta see the page source code to know what we can find!

# Task 5 HTML Injection

HTML Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page. If a website fails to sanitise user input (filter any "malicious" text that a user inputs into a website), and that input is used on the page, an attacker can inject HTML code into a vulnerable website.

## View the website on this task and inject HTML so that a malicious link to http://hacker.com is shown.

Simply we make a "a" tag that we can put the given link so we can inject the website
